We ought not to have a situation in which we set up an inquiry and then we can only do half the job because police inquiries are ongoing.\\\"\\nMr Evans, who was a Wales Office minister in the 1990s when the UK government set up the Waterhouse inquiry into abuse allegations at children's homes in north Wales, added: \\\"It seems to me that the police inquiries are now at the forefront.\\\"\\nHe said Mrs May should not be blamed for delays to the inquiry, which has been held up by the resignation of her first two choices of chairperson.\\nVictims must have confidence in the process, Mr Evans said, \\\"and so the reason we are in the situation we are in is that we are struggling to find a chairman that the victims' groups will have confidence in\\\".\",\n          \"One head teacher decided \\\"all reading can be done on iPads,\\\" a delegate told the Association of Teachers and Lecturers' annual conference.\\nThe union voted to lobby for libraries to be included in Ofsted inspections.\\nA Department for Education spokeswoman said that school libraries \\\"played a vital role\\\".\\nCathy Tattersfield from Derbyshire quoted international evidence suggesting a positive correlation between good school libraries and student attainment.\\nMs Tattersfield said she had been \\\"shocked\\\" that two secondary academies had \\\"recently closed or attempted to close their libraries and several of them have had their librarian hours or posts cut, mostly in the ex-mining areas of Derbyshire\\\".\\nA survey of 485 ATL members last month suggested a patchy picture on library provision said Ms Tattersfield.\\n\\\"It seems to be feast or famine.\\n\\\"Some secondary provision is fine, cherished and secured,\\\" - but others faced reduced opening hours, conversion to e-learning centres, cuts in staff hours, or librarians having been removed or replaced by support staff or teachers.\\n\\\"We identified a third of secondary schools have had cuts of 40% or more since 2010, with 20% redundancies in library staff at their school.\\\"\\nAnother delegate said his school library, closed last year, had provided a host of benefits to pupils, from paired reading for special needs pupils to introducing able readers to new authors and running a range of enrichment activities.\\nHe said the library's books and magazines had been distributed among subject departments.\\n\\\"Lesley Mumbray-Williams whose school dispensed with her services as librarian said a third of the stock had ended up in skips within three weeks of her leaving.\\\"\\nAnother delegate said the librarian post in their school had not been filled and the library doors were often locked.\\nOf the education staff who responded to the survey:\\nA Department for Education spokeswoman said: \\\"We want all children to read widely and well and believe school libraries can play a vital role in fostering that love of reading.\\n\\\"We trust schools to decide on whether to provide and maintain a library service for their pupils.\\\"\",\n          \"The mix-up led to the body of Philip Bradburn being cremated instead of that of Conservative MEP Philip Bradbourn.\\nA failure to provide written records created confusion between the two similar sounding surnames, the Heart of England NHS Trust said.\\nThe trust and Central England Co-operative apologised for the blunder.\\nFormer MEP Mr Bradbourn died at Good Hope Hospital, Sutton Coldfield on 20 December.\\nMr Bradburn died at University Hospital Birmingham four days later and his body was sent to a funeral directors run by Central England Co-operative.\\nAs Good Hope's mortuary was nearing capacity, a request was made by hospital staff to move four bodies -

We ought not to have a situation in which we set up an inquiry and then we can only do half the job because police inquiries are ongoing.\\\"\\nMr Evans, who was a Wales Office minister in the 1990s when the UK government set up the Waterhouse inquiry into abuse allegations at children's homes in north Wales, added: \\\"It seems to me that the police inquiries are now at the forefront.\\\"\\nHe said Mrs May should not be blamed for delays to the inquiry, which has been held up by the resignation of her first two choices of chairperson.\\nVictims must have confidence in the process, Mr Evans said, \\\"and so the reason we are in the situation we are in is that we are struggling to find a chairman that the victims' groups will have confidence in\\\".\",\n          \"One head teacher decided \\\"all reading can be done on iPads,\\\" a delegate told the Association of Teachers and Lecturers' annual conference.\\nThe union voted to lobby for libraries to be included in Ofsted inspections.\\nA Department for Education spokeswoman said that school libraries \\\"played a vital role\\\".\\nCathy Tattersfield from Derbyshire quoted international evidence suggesting a positive correlation between good school libraries and student attainment.\\nMs Tattersfield said she had been \\\"shocked\\\" that two secondary academies had \\\"recently closed or attempted to close their libraries and several of them have had their librarian hours or posts cut, mostly in the ex-mining areas of Derbyshire\\\".\\nA survey of 485 ATL members last month suggested a patchy picture on library provision said Ms Tattersfield.\\n\\\"It seems to be feast or famine.\\n\\\"Some secondary provision is fine, cherished and secured,\\\" - but others faced reduced opening hours, conversion to e-learning centres, cuts in staff hours, or librarians having been removed or replaced by support staff or teachers.\\n\\\"We identified a third of secondary schools have had cuts of 40% or more since 2010, with 20% redundancies in library staff at their school.\\\"\\nAnother delegate said his school library, closed last year, had provided a host of benefits to pupils, from paired reading for special needs pupils to introducing able readers to new authors and running a range of enrichment activities.\\nHe said the library's books and magazines had been distributed among subject departments.\\n\\\"Lesley Mumbray-Williams whose school dispensed with her services as librarian said a third of the stock had ended up in skips within three weeks of her leaving.\\\"\\nAnother delegate said the librarian post in their school had not been filled and the library doors were often locked.\\nOf the education staff who responded to the survey:\\nA Department for Education spokeswoman said: \\\"We want all children to read widely and well and believe school libraries can play a vital role in fostering that love of reading.\\n\\\"We trust schools to decide on whether to provide and maintain a library service for their pupils.\\\"\",\n          \"The mix-up led to the body of Philip Bradburn being cremated instead of that of Conservative MEP Philip Bradbourn.\\nA failure to provide written records created confusion between the two similar sounding surnames, the Heart of England NHS Trust said.\\nThe trust and Central England Co-operative apologised for the blunder.\\nFormer MEP Mr Bradbourn died at Good Hope Hospital, Sutton Coldfield on 20 December.\\nMr Bradburn died at University Hospital Birmingham four days later and his body was sent to a funeral directors run by Central England Co-operative.\\nAs Good Hope's mortuary was nearing capacity, a request was made by hospital staff to move four bodies -

Where am I going to live? Have I got somewhere where I can see my daughter.\"\\n\"You\\'re put out among the same sort of people doing the same sort of thing, and it\\'s difficult, it\\'s difficult to get away from it. It\\'s like every man for himself, there\\'s nothing.\"\\nMarc has now found stable accommodation with homeless charity Emmaus and said it had been life changing.\\n\"You feel safe, you got hot food, you\\'ve got company of people in similar situations to yourself but all dealing with different issues. It\\'s a constructive, helpful atmosphere,\" he said.\\nTom Clarke, chief executive of Emmaus South Wales, agreed there was not enough support available.\\n\"We do still see [people] homeless on the streets, so clearly they haven\\'t got accommodation and haven\\'t got provision,\" he said.\\n\"I think the key is connecting people with the services they need. I don\\'t delude myself that Emmaus can offer a one size fits all for everyone, we can\\'t.\\n\"But there must be other opportunities and given suitable encouragement I believe that can and should happen.\"\\nA Welsh Government spokesman said the national pathway for homeless services to children, young people and adults in the secure estate had prevented many people from losing their home whilst serving their prison sentence.\\nIt added there were already significant demands for one-bedroom flats across the public and private sector and it was providing 20,000 new affordable homes in the next five years.'"
