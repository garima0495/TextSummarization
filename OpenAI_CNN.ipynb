They might be better served singing The Grand Old Duke of York. Only those 10,000 men on that hill could possibly relate to the absurdities of Bournemouth\\u2019s afternoon engagement with Sheffield Wednesday. In sequence, they went from top to third to second to top to second again in the space of one 2-2 draw. They are neither up nor down; they are neither falling apart nor running away with the loot. How delightfully fitting in this remarkable season of Championship football that a team unbeaten in 10 before Saturday\\u2019s kick-off would draw at home to a side with nothing to gain or lose. Chris Maguire converts an injury time penalty so salvage a draw for Sheffield Wednesday at Dean Court . Maguire celebrates his late, late strike as the Owls held Bournemouth to a draw on their home turf . The battle for automatic promotion to the Premier League is hotting up with three points covering four teams and with two games to play. 1 Watford 85pts To play Apr 25 Brighton (a), May 2 Sheff Wed (h) 2 Bournemouth 84pts Apr 27 Bolton (h), May 2 Charlton (a) 3 Middlesbrough 84pts Apr 25 Fulham (a), May 2 Brighton (h) 4 Norwich 82pts Apr 25 Rotherham (a), May 2 Fulham (h) And how. They dominated, then they trailed, then they levelled and had a man sent off. Then their fans got mocked by a Wednesday player and then they led and then the player that did the mocking scored a penalty in stoppage time that irritated the home crowd all over again. Brilliantly bonkers. How significantly will Chris Maguire of Wednesday feature in Bournemouth\\u2019s final analysis? How serious was Eddie Howe when he indicated that the referees feel Bournemouth, at 15 kicks, have reached their quota for penalties this season? He was unhappy, to put it mildly, that Lewis Buxton was cleared of fouling Callum Wilson in the second half, telling a radio station: \\u2018It looked like the referees have come together and talked about Callum Wilson and said, \\u201cDon\\u2019t give him any penalties because Bournemouth have had too many this season and we don\\u2019t want them to have any more\\u201d.\\u2019 Kieran Lee (second right) celebrates with his team after his\\u00a036th minute header put the visitors ahead . He toned down his sentiments by the time he met the written press and that is probably for the best. Howe is a good and rational man; certainly one of the most upwardly mobile and promising of all English coaches. A sign of the pressure of this incredible promotion race, then? Who could blame him if it was? Middlesbrough had beaten Norwich on Friday night to take Bournemouth\\u2019s place at the top and at 3.36pm on Saturday Kieran Lee put Wednesday in front. When Craig Cathcart scored a magnificent volley for Watford against Birmingham \\u2014 the only goal of the match \\u2014 Watford were top and Bournemouth were third. The natives grew restless. Then Yann Kermorgant equalised, lifting Bournemouth back up to second, and a home fan screamed into a camcorder held by a policeman. Senses take leave at this time of a season, which might also explain how Simon Francis quickly landed himself a second yellow card. Maguire turned to the home fans and motioned for them to dry their eyes. Alas, Matt Ritchie then hit the top corner and put Bournemouth top again but in stoppage time Adam Smith fouled Atdhe Nuhiu for a penalty. \\u2018No-one will blame Adam,\\u2019 Howe said. \\u2018We will tell him how much we love him tonight.\\u2019 Yann Kermorgant (second left equalises for the Cherries with 20 minutes of the contest remaining . Bournemouth's Simon Francis is dismissed by referee Paul Tierney in the 78th minute . Which is nice, though Maguire did score the penalty and Bournemouth did fall. Again. Howe said he felt \\u2018heartbroken\\u2019. Over the course of two spells at Bournemouth he has led them from League Two to this precipice, occasionally spending his own money in the darker days when the club was broke. Today, in their tiny stadium where parking costs \\u00a31 and stewards are encouraged to say hello, they are so close to something incredible. Tommy Elphick, Bournemouth\\u2019s captain, gave something of an insight into what his manager has been going through. \\u2018He is probably the first one every day in at 6 or 7 and probably leaving at 6 or 7 at night and the players follow suit,\\u2019 he said. \\u2018We realise how much he does for us. When a single person gives that much of their life towards you, you only want to repay them.\\u2019 But the best intentions can only do so much in a race like this. Promotion is worth somewhere in the region of \\u00a3120million and, as of the weekend, eight teams are in the hunt for three spots. Multiple narratives, multiple charges and multiple futures on the line. It\\u2019s crazy but it\\u2019s brilliant. With only two games to play it has been a magnificent race up the hill. Matt Ritchie races away to celebrate after his 85th minute free kick put the home side ahead for the first time .\",\n          \"A professor testifying in a cold-case trial in Southern California said Thursday that she was intimidated into identifying her rapist to the man now charged with killing him in 1995. Norma Esparza, who pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter in the case and agreed to testify, said from the stand that her ex-boyfriend, Gianni Van, now 45, was outraged when he heard about the assault and demanded that she find and point out Gonzalo Ramirez at the bar where she met him. Van is now charged with the murder of Ramirez. Prosecutors allege Van and friends kidnapped and beat Ramirez and left him by the roadside. 'I was intimidated': Norma Esparza, pictured here during a press conference in 2013, testified Thursday at the murder trial of ex-boyfriend, Gianni Van, 45, who is charged with killing a man in 1995 she claims raped her. She says Van intimidated her into identifying the murder victim,\\u00a0Gonzalo Ramirez . Accused: Gianni Van, 45, (left) is accused of the 1995 murder of Gonzalo Ramirez (right), whose blindfolded, bloodied body was found on the side of an Irvine, California road having suffered 30 blows with a cleaver . 'We were sitting around a booth next to an entrance or exit, and at some point I see Gonzalo Ramirez walk by,' Esparza said of the night in 1995, according to the Orange County Register. 'When I see him, I cringe,' she said, showing how she reacted by bending her head down and putting her face in her hands. 'I didn't want to see him again.' Esparza, testifying in the trial's second day, said she was 'broken' by the assault, that Van was directing his anger not just at her attacker but at her, and that she did not know what Van and his friends would do once she pointed out Ramirez. 'He would just insult me,' she said. 'He would rant and just be explosive.' Revenge? Prosecutors say Van killed Ramirez as revenge for raping his on-and-off girlfriend Norma Esparza (pictured). They divorced and Esparza went on to become a psychology professor in Europe and the mother of a little girl (left). Esparza is pictured right upon her arrest while re-entering the U.S. in 2012 . Van's lawyer, Jeremy Dolnick, said his client had no role in the murder and knew nothing of any plans to kidnap or kill Ramirez. The case has drawn international attention since Esparza \\u2014 who went on to become a psychology professor and moved to France \\u2014 was arrested in 2012, provoking an outcry from advocates for sexual assault victims who say the case sends a chilling message to rape survivors. Esparza, 40, is expected to receive a six-year sentence in exchange for testifying at the trials of Van and another defendant. During opening statements this week, Senior Deputy District Attorney Mike Murray showed graphic photos of Ramirez's blindfolded, mangled body lying on the side of the road in a pool of blood. 'Gonzalo Ramirez was targeted, and he was targeted by somebody who was going to make sure he suffered,' Murray said. 'Whether Norma Esparza was sexually assaulted or not, for our purposes today, doesn't matter. What matters is she told the defendant that. Involved? The prosecution alleges Van was aided by his friend Kody Tran (center) \\u00a0and Tran's wife Diane Tran (right) as well as Tran's employee Shannon Gries (left). Kody Tran killed himself during an unrelated standoff with police in 2013. Diane Tran has taken a plea deal and will testify against Van. Shannon Gries awaits trial on murder charges . Prosecutors say Ramirez was taken to the transmission shop of his friend Kody Tran, where he was blindfolded, chained up and beaten. They say he was found having suffered 30 blows from a meat cleaver, reports the Orange County Register. The prosecution alleges Van was aided by Tran and Tran's wife Diane Tran as well as Tran's employee Shannon Gries. His body was found dumped on the side of a road in Irvine. 'It was beyond horrific,' Murray said. 'It was the act of an incredibly angry man...The defendant was out of his mind with anger.' 'He felt that he had been violated,' Murray said of Van.\",\n          \"A 51-year-old mother   fought off an intruder after finding him standing over her young daughter.

They might be better served singing The Grand Old Duke of York. Only those 10,000 men on that hill could possibly relate to the absurdities of Bournemouth\\u2019s afternoon engagement with Sheffield Wednesday. In sequence, they went from top to third to second to top to second again in the space of one 2-2 draw. They are neither up nor down; they are neither falling apart nor running away with the loot. How delightfully fitting in this remarkable season of Championship football that a team unbeaten in 10 before Saturday\\u2019s kick-off would draw at home to a side with nothing to gain or lose. Chris Maguire converts an injury time penalty so salvage a draw for Sheffield Wednesday at Dean Court . Maguire celebrates his late, late strike as the Owls held Bournemouth to a draw on their home turf . The battle for automatic promotion to the Premier League is hotting up with three points covering four teams and with two games to play. 1 Watford 85pts To play Apr 25 Brighton (a), May 2 Sheff Wed (h) 2 Bournemouth 84pts Apr 27 Bolton (h), May 2 Charlton (a) 3 Middlesbrough 84pts Apr 25 Fulham (a), May 2 Brighton (h) 4 Norwich 82pts Apr 25 Rotherham (a), May 2 Fulham (h) And how. They dominated, then they trailed, then they levelled and had a man sent off. Then their fans got mocked by a Wednesday player and then they led and then the player that did the mocking scored a penalty in stoppage time that irritated the home crowd all over again. Brilliantly bonkers. How significantly will Chris Maguire of Wednesday feature in Bournemouth\\u2019s final analysis? How serious was Eddie Howe when he indicated that the referees feel Bournemouth, at 15 kicks, have reached their quota for penalties this season? He was unhappy, to put it mildly, that Lewis Buxton was cleared of fouling Callum Wilson in the second half, telling a radio station: \\u2018It looked like the referees have come together and talked about Callum Wilson and said, \\u201cDon\\u2019t give him any penalties because Bournemouth have had too many this season and we don\\u2019t want them to have any more\\u201d.\\u2019 Kieran Lee (second right) celebrates with his team after his\\u00a036th minute header put the visitors ahead . He toned down his sentiments by the time he met the written press and that is probably for the best. Howe is a good and rational man; certainly one of the most upwardly mobile and promising of all English coaches. A sign of the pressure of this incredible promotion race, then? Who could blame him if it was? Middlesbrough had beaten Norwich on Friday night to take Bournemouth\\u2019s place at the top and at 3.36pm on Saturday Kieran Lee put Wednesday in front. When Craig Cathcart scored a magnificent volley for Watford against Birmingham \\u2014 the only goal of the match \\u2014 Watford were top and Bournemouth were third. The natives grew restless. Then Yann Kermorgant equalised, lifting Bournemouth back up to second, and a home fan screamed into a camcorder held by a policeman. Senses take leave at this time of a season, which might also explain how Simon Francis quickly landed himself a second yellow card. Maguire turned to the home fans and motioned for them to dry their eyes. Alas, Matt Ritchie then hit the top corner and put Bournemouth top again but in stoppage time Adam Smith fouled Atdhe Nuhiu for a penalty. \\u2018No-one will blame Adam,\\u2019 Howe said. \\u2018We will tell him how much we love him tonight.\\u2019 Yann Kermorgant (second left equalises for the Cherries with 20 minutes of the contest remaining . Bournemouth's Simon Francis is dismissed by referee Paul Tierney in the 78th minute . Which is nice, though Maguire did score the penalty and Bournemouth did fall. Again. Howe said he felt \\u2018heartbroken\\u2019. Over the course of two spells at Bournemouth he has led them from League Two to this precipice, occasionally spending his own money in the darker days when the club was broke. Today, in their tiny stadium where parking costs \\u00a31 and stewards are encouraged to say hello, they are so close to something incredible. Tommy Elphick, Bournemouth\\u2019s captain, gave something of an insight into what his manager has been going through. \\u2018He is probably the first one every day in at 6 or 7 and probably leaving at 6 or 7 at night and the players follow suit,\\u2019 he said. \\u2018We realise how much he does for us. When a single person gives that much of their life towards you, you only want to repay them.\\u2019 But the best intentions can only do so much in a race like this. Promotion is worth somewhere in the region of \\u00a3120million and, as of the weekend, eight teams are in the hunt for three spots. Multiple narratives, multiple charges and multiple futures on the line. It\\u2019s crazy but it\\u2019s brilliant. With only two games to play it has been a magnificent race up the hill. Matt Ritchie races away to celebrate after his 85th minute free kick put the home side ahead for the first time .\",\n          \"A professor testifying in a cold-case trial in Southern California said Thursday that she was intimidated into identifying her rapist to the man now charged with killing him in 1995. Norma Esparza, who pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter in the case and agreed to testify, said from the stand that her ex-boyfriend, Gianni Van, now 45, was outraged when he heard about the assault and demanded that she find and point out Gonzalo Ramirez at the bar where she met him. Van is now charged with the murder of Ramirez. Prosecutors allege Van and friends kidnapped and beat Ramirez and left him by the roadside. 'I was intimidated': Norma Esparza, pictured here during a press conference in 2013, testified Thursday at the murder trial of ex-boyfriend, Gianni Van, 45, who is charged with killing a man in 1995 she claims raped her. She says Van intimidated her into identifying the murder victim,\\u00a0Gonzalo Ramirez . Accused: Gianni Van, 45, (left) is accused of the 1995 murder of Gonzalo Ramirez (right), whose blindfolded, bloodied body was found on the side of an Irvine, California road having suffered 30 blows with a cleaver . 'We were sitting around a booth next to an entrance or exit, and at some point I see Gonzalo Ramirez walk by,' Esparza said of the night in 1995, according to the Orange County Register. 'When I see him, I cringe,' she said, showing how she reacted by bending her head down and putting her face in her hands. 'I didn't want to see him again.' Esparza, testifying in the trial's second day, said she was 'broken' by the assault, that Van was directing his anger not just at her attacker but at her, and that she did not know what Van and his friends would do once she pointed out Ramirez. 'He would just insult me,' she said. 'He would rant and just be explosive.' Revenge? Prosecutors say Van killed Ramirez as revenge for raping his on-and-off girlfriend Norma Esparza (pictured). They divorced and Esparza went on to become a psychology professor in Europe and the mother of a little girl (left). Esparza is pictured right upon her arrest while re-entering the U.S. in 2012 . Van's lawyer, Jeremy Dolnick, said his client had no role in the murder and knew nothing of any plans to kidnap or kill Ramirez. The case has drawn international attention since Esparza \\u2014 who went on to become a psychology professor and moved to France \\u2014 was arrested in 2012, provoking an outcry from advocates for sexual assault victims who say the case sends a chilling message to rape survivors. Esparza, 40, is expected to receive a six-year sentence in exchange for testifying at the trials of Van and another defendant. During opening statements this week, Senior Deputy District Attorney Mike Murray showed graphic photos of Ramirez's blindfolded, mangled body lying on the side of the road in a pool of blood. 'Gonzalo Ramirez was targeted, and he was targeted by somebody who was going to make sure he suffered,' Murray said. 'Whether Norma Esparza was sexually assaulted or not, for our purposes today, doesn't matter. What matters is she told the defendant that. Involved? The prosecution alleges Van was aided by his friend Kody Tran (center) \\u00a0and Tran's wife Diane Tran (right) as well as Tran's employee Shannon Gries (left). Kody Tran killed himself during an unrelated standoff with police in 2013. Diane Tran has taken a plea deal and will testify against Van. Shannon Gries awaits trial on murder charges . Prosecutors say Ramirez was taken to the transmission shop of his friend Kody Tran, where he was blindfolded, chained up and beaten. They say he was found having suffered 30 blows from a meat cleaver, reports the Orange County Register. The prosecution alleges Van was aided by Tran and Tran's wife Diane Tran as well as Tran's employee Shannon Gries. His body was found dumped on the side of a road in Irvine. 'It was beyond horrific,' Murray said. 'It was the act of an incredibly angry man...The defendant was out of his mind with anger.'

              "'(CNN)The Palestinian Authority officially became the 123rd member of the International Criminal Court on Wednesday, a step that gives the court jurisdiction over alleged crimes in Palestinian territories. The formal accession was marked with a ceremony at The Hague, in the Netherlands, where the court is based. The Palestinians signed the ICC\\'s founding Rome Statute in January, when they also accepted its jurisdiction over alleged crimes committed \"in the occupied Palestinian territory, including East Jerusalem, since June 13, 2014.\" Later that month, the ICC opened a preliminary examination into the situation in Palestinian territories, paving the way for possible war crimes investigations against Israelis. As members of the court, Palestinians may be subject to counter-charges as well. Israel and the United States, neither of which is an ICC member, opposed the Palestinians\\' efforts to join the body. But Palestinian Foreign Minister Riad al-Malki, speaking at Wednesday\\'s ceremony, said it was a move toward greater justice. \"As Palestine formally becomes a State Party to the Rome Statute today, the world is also a step closer to ending a long era of impunity and injustice,\" he said, according to an ICC news release. \"Indeed, today brings us closer to our shared goals of justice and peace.\" Judge Kuniko Ozaki, a vice president of the ICC, said acceding to the treaty was just the first step for the Palestinians. \"As the Rome Statute today enters into force for the State of Palestine, Palestine acquires all the rights as well as responsibilities that come with being a State Party to the Statute. These are substantive commitments, which cannot be taken lightly,\" she said. Rights group Human Rights Watch welcomed the development. \"Governments seeking to penalize Palestine for joining the ICC should immediately end their pressure, and countries that support universal acceptance of the court\\'s treaty should speak out to welcome its membership,\" said Balkees Jarrah, international justice counsel for the group. \"What\\'s objectionable is the attempts to undermine international justice, not Palestine\\'s decision to join a treaty to which over 100 countries around the world are members.\" In January, when the preliminary ICC examination was opened, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu described it as an outrage, saying the court was overstepping its boundaries. The United States also said it \"strongly\" disagreed with the court\\'s decision. \"As we have said repeatedly, we do not believe that Palestine is a state and therefore we do not believe that it is eligible to join the ICC,\" the State Department said in a statement. It urged the warring sides to resolve their differences through direct negotiations. \"We will continue to oppose actions against Israel at the ICC as counterproductive to the cause of peace,\" it said. But the ICC begs to differ with the definition of a state for its purposes and refers to the territories as \"Palestine.\" While a preliminary examination is not a formal investigation, it allows the court to review evidence and determine whether to investigate suspects on both sides. Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda said her office would \"conduct its analysis in full independence and impartiality.\" The war between Israel and Hamas militants in Gaza last summer left more than 2,000 people dead. The inquiry will include alleged war crimes committed since June. The International Criminal Court was set up in 2002 to prosecute genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. CNN\\'s Vasco Cotovio, Kareem Khadder and Faith Karimi contributed to this report.'"

They might be better served singing The Grand Old Duke of York. Only those 10,000 men on that hill could possibly relate to the absurdities of Bournemouth\\u2019s afternoon engagement with Sheffield Wednesday. In sequence, they went from top to third to second to top to second again in the space of one 2-2 draw. They are neither up nor down; they are neither falling apart nor running away with the loot. How delightfully fitting in this remarkable season of Championship football that a team unbeaten in 10 before Saturday\\u2019s kick-off would draw at home to a side with nothing to gain or lose. Chris Maguire converts an injury time penalty so salvage a draw for Sheffield Wednesday at Dean Court . Maguire celebrates his late, late strike as the Owls held Bournemouth to a draw on their home turf . The battle for automatic promotion to the Premier League is hotting up with three points covering four teams and with two games to play. 1 Watford 85pts To play Apr 25 Brighton (a), May 2 Sheff Wed (h) 2 Bournemouth 84pts Apr 27 Bolton (h), May 2 Charlton (a) 3 Middlesbrough 84pts Apr 25 Fulham (a), May 2 Brighton (h) 4 Norwich 82pts Apr 25 Rotherham (a), May 2 Fulham (h) And how. They dominated, then they trailed, then they levelled and had a man sent off. Then their fans got mocked by a Wednesday player and then they led and then the player that did the mocking scored a penalty in stoppage time that irritated the home crowd all over again. Brilliantly bonkers. How significantly will Chris Maguire of Wednesday feature in Bournemouth\\u2019s final analysis? How serious was Eddie Howe when he indicated that the referees feel Bournemouth, at 15 kicks, have reached their quota for penalties this season? He was unhappy, to put it mildly, that Lewis Buxton was cleared of fouling Callum Wilson in the second half, telling a radio station: \\u2018It looked like the referees have come together and talked about Callum Wilson and said, \\u201cDon\\u2019t give him any penalties because Bournemouth have had too many this season and we don\\u2019t want them to have any more\\u201d.\\u2019 Kieran Lee (second right) celebrates with his team after his\\u00a036th minute header put the visitors ahead . He toned down his sentiments by the time he met the written press and that is probably for the best. Howe is a good and rational man; certainly one of the most upwardly mobile and promising of all English coaches. A sign of the pressure of this incredible promotion race, then? Who could blame him if it was? Middlesbrough had beaten Norwich on Friday night to take Bournemouth\\u2019s place at the top and at 3.36pm on Saturday Kieran Lee put Wednesday in front. When Craig Cathcart scored a magnificent volley for Watford against Birmingham \\u2014 the only goal of the match \\u2014 Watford were top and Bournemouth were third. The natives grew restless. Then Yann Kermorgant equalised, lifting Bournemouth back up to second, and a home fan screamed into a camcorder held by a policeman. Senses take leave at this time of a season, which might also explain how Simon Francis quickly landed himself a second yellow card. Maguire turned to the home fans and motioned for them to dry their eyes. Alas, Matt Ritchie then hit the top corner and put Bournemouth top again but in stoppage time Adam Smith fouled Atdhe Nuhiu for a penalty. \\u2018No-one will blame Adam,\\u2019 Howe said. \\u2018We will tell him how much we love him tonight.\\u2019 Yann Kermorgant (second left equalises for the Cherries with 20 minutes of the contest remaining . Bournemouth's Simon Francis is dismissed by referee Paul Tierney in the 78th minute . Which is nice, though Maguire did score the penalty and Bournemouth did fall. Again. Howe said he felt \\u2018heartbroken\\u2019. Over the course of two spells at Bournemouth he has led them from League Two to this precipice, occasionally spending his own money in the darker days when the club was broke. Today, in their tiny stadium where parking costs \\u00a31 and stewards are encouraged to say hello, they are so close to something incredible. Tommy Elphick, Bournemouth\\u2019s captain, gave something of an insight into what his manager has been going through. \\u2018He is probably the first one every day in at 6 or 7 and probably leaving at 6 or 7 at night and the players follow suit,\\u2019 he said. \\u2018We realise how much he does for us. When a single person gives that much of their life towards you, you only want to repay them.\\u2019 But the best intentions can only do so much in a race like this. Promotion is worth somewhere in the region of \\u00a3120million and, as of the weekend, eight teams are in the hunt for three spots. Multiple narratives, multiple charges and multiple futures on the line. It\\u2019s crazy but it\\u2019s brilliant. With only two games to play it has been a magnificent race up the hill. Matt Ritchie races away to celebrate after his 85th minute free kick put the home side ahead for the first time .\",\n          \"A professor testifying in a cold-case trial in Southern California said Thursday that she was intimidated into identifying her rapist to the man now charged with killing him in 1995. Norma Esparza, who pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter in the case and agreed to testify, said from the stand that her ex-boyfriend, Gianni Van, now 45, was outraged when he heard about the assault and demanded that she find and point out Gonzalo Ramirez at the bar where she met him. Van is now charged with the murder of Ramirez. Prosecutors allege Van and friends kidnapped and beat Ramirez and left him by the roadside. 'I was intimidated': Norma Esparza, pictured here during a press conference in 2013, testified Thursday at the murder trial of ex-boyfriend, Gianni Van, 45, who is charged with killing a man in 1995 she claims raped her. She says Van intimidated her into identifying the murder victim,\\u00a0Gonzalo Ramirez . Accused: Gianni Van, 45, (left) is accused of the 1995 murder of Gonzalo Ramirez (right), whose blindfolded, bloodied body was found on the side of an Irvine, California road having suffered 30 blows with a cleaver . 'We were sitting around a booth next to an entrance or exit, and at some point I see Gonzalo Ramirez walk by,' Esparza said of the night in 1995, according to the Orange County Register. 'When I see him, I cringe,' she said, showing how she reacted by bending her head down and putting her face in her hands. 'I didn't want to see him again.' Esparza, testifying in the trial's second day, said she was 'broken' by the assault, that Van was directing his anger not just at her attacker but at her, and that she did not know what Van and his friends would do once she pointed out Ramirez. 'He would just insult me,' she said. 'He would rant and just be explosive.' Revenge? Prosecutors say Van killed Ramirez as revenge for raping his on-and-off girlfriend Norma Esparza (pictured). They divorced and Esparza went on to become a psychology professor in Europe and the mother of a little girl (left). Esparza is pictured right upon her arrest while re-entering the U.S. in 2012 . Van's lawyer, Jeremy Dolnick, said his client had no role in the murder and knew nothing of any plans to kidnap or kill Ramirez. The case has drawn international attention since Esparza \\u2014 who went on to become a psychology professor and moved to France \\u2014 was arrested in 2012, provoking an outcry from advocates for sexual assault victims who say the case sends a chilling message to rape survivors. Esparza, 40, is expected to receive a six-year sentence in exchange for testifying at the trials of Van and another defendant. During opening statements this week, Senior Deputy District Attorney Mike Murray showed graphic photos of Ramirez's blindfolded, mangled body lying on the side of the road in a pool of blood. 'Gonzalo Ramirez was targeted, and he was targeted by somebody who was going to make sure he suffered,' Murray said. 'Whether Norma Esparza was sexually assaulted or not, for our purposes today, doesn't matter. What matters is she told the defendant that. Involved? The prosecution alleges Van was aided by his friend Kody Tran (center) \\u00a0and Tran's wife Diane Tran (right) as well as Tran's employee Shannon Gries (left). Kody Tran killed himself during an unrelated standoff with police in 2013. Diane Tran has taken a plea deal and will testify against Van. Shannon Gries awaits trial on murder charges . Prosecutors say Ramirez was taken to the transmission shop of his friend Kody Tran, where he was blindfolded, chained up and beaten. They say he was found having suffered 30 blows from a meat cleaver, reports the Orange County Register. The prosecution alleges Van was aided by Tran and Tran's wife Diane Tran as well as Tran's employee Shannon Gries. His body was found dumped on the side of a road in Irvine. 'It was beyond horrific,' Murray said. 'It was the act of an incredibly angry man...The defendant was out of his mind with anger.' 'He felt that he had been violated,' Murray said of Van.\",\n          \"A 51-year-old mother   fought off an intruder after finding him standing over her young daughter.
